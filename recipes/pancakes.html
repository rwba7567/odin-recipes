        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared 
           from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface 
           such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs until fluffy; beat in sugar and salt. In a separate bowl, stir flour and baking powder 
                together. Stir milk and flour mixture alternately into eggs, starting and ending with milk.</li>

            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter 
                onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Do not turn pancake until 
                tiny holes appear all over the uncooked side (top) of the pancake in the pan. Brown on 
                both sides and serve hot.</li>
